## Elasticsearch + Kibana Docker Compose file

This project contains a docker-compose.yml file that creates an elasticsearch 2 node
cluster and a Kibana conected to that cluster.

Just clone this repo, cd into it and run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

After a few minutes click [here](http://localhost:5601) to enter Kibana.

Thats it!
